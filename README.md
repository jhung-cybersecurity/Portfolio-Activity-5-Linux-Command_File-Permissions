## Objective

The goal of this activity is to showcase that I have a general understanding of file permissions in Linux and I am able to utlize my knowledge in relevant real life tasks.  

Some of the tasks I will be showcasing are:
1. Check file permissions for both hidden & non-hidden files  
2. Read and understand permission strings in Linux
3. Change file permissions by removing & adding permissions to `users`, `groups` and `others`
4. Change directory permissions
